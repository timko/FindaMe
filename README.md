FindaMe
=======
For those uninitiated in the ways of Rails, to see what this thing looks like:

1.cd into the FindaMe directory

2.Run the 'rails server' command

3.You can now view the web app on your web browser at the address 'localhost:3000/locations'

the html files (which are actually haml files) for the views are in app/views

if you need to login, just put golds in the email field and studio in the password field
